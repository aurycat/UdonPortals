// This portal shader lets you stick your hand into the portal without it
// getting 'cut off' like it normally would if you stick your hand into a
// wall. It gives the portal a more seamless feeling.
//
// It has some limitations: surfaces nearby behind the portal (e.g. the wall
// the portal is on) need to be on a lower render queue than this, otherwise
// they will render over the portal just like your hand would, and avatars
// need to be on a higher render queue than this.
//
// Additionally, to avoid some undesireable visuals, I recommend to not have
// anything except a wall (on a lower render queue, as mentioned above) physically
// behind the portal when using this shader.

//  1.0 (2023-01-13)
//  1.3 (2023-10-29) Switched from a method using _CameraDepthTexture to a 
//                   method using the stencil buffer. Using _CDT has a number
//                   of drawbacks including: not working for non-shadowcasting
//                   objects, breaking MSAA, & requiring a real-time light in
//                   the scene to force Unity to render _CDT.
//  1.5 (2024-11-17) Don't render in handheld camera.
//
// ============================================================================
//  How it works
//  (Very verbose so I remember how it works when I come back to it later...)
// ============================================================================
//
// To create the illusion of being able to "reach through" the portal, we want
// certain things (e.g. avatars, pickups) to render over the portal, while
// other things (e.g. the wall behind the portal) to be occluded by the portal.
// However, we can't just always draw walls on behind and avatars on top:
//
//  - Walls should interact normally with the portal, as if it were a normal
//    object. Walls behind the portal get occluded, walls in front occlude.
//    Usual 'ZTest LEqual'.
//
//  - Avatars, etc, need to render on top of the portal, so that a hand stuck
//    through the portal will not get cut off. BUT! Things that are far behind
//    the portal, like a player in another room, shouldn't render on top of
//    the portal. We only want to render avatars on top when they are within a
//    certain distance behind the portal.
//
// Achieving both of these requirements at once is tricky.
// Here is the method I've used:
//
// 1. Walls and other things that should interact normally with the portal go
//    on a render queue below the portal (they render before this shader).
//    Avatars and other things that should be able to reach through the portal
//    go on a render queue above the portal (they render after this shader).
//    On its own this has no effect (for opaque things) because of z-testing.
//
// 2. The portal mesh is drawn with normal z-testing, but a stencil buffer bit
//    is set everywhere the mesh is drawn. This creates a sort-of "depth mask"
//    where a next pass can use the stencil buffer instead of a real z-test.
//
// 3. A second shader pass is set to `ZTest Always` so it draws regardless of
//    actual depth, but then uses the "depth mask" from the first pass to only
//    draw where needed. This pass only writes out the inset depth.
//
// 4. Therefore, the portal gets drawn with a normal ztest, but writes out an
//    inset depth. Things that render afterwards will z-test against the inset
//    depth and so can appear to reach into the portal!
//
// ============================================================================
//
// NOTE: This shader uses stencil bit 5 (ref value 32). If your world needs
// that bit for something else at this draw-queue, you can change all the
// "32"s in the Stencil blocks below to some other power of two.
//
