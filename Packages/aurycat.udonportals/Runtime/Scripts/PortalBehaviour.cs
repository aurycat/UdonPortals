// History:
//  1.0 (2023-01-12)
//  1.1 (2023-08-20) Code formatting fixes.
//  1.2 (2023-09-04) Fixed rendering issues in desktop mode introduced by Unity 2022
//                   in the VRC open beta; fixed teleporting issues introduced by a
//                   change in the behavior of VRCPlayerApi.GetRotation; improved
//                   inspector editor UI; added noVisuals and useObliqueProjection
//                   options; black out portals in VR as local player leaves instance
//                   to prevent nauseating visuals.
//  1.3 (2023-11-12) Some fixes to the oblique near clipping plane, and better support
//                   for using a portal mesh that isn't a flad quad to avoid visual
//                   flashes when walking through the portals. Improve the layout of
//                   properties in the inspector again. Add 'behaviour mode' for
//                   physics only or visuals only portals. Add momentum snapping option.
//                   Support user-changed FOVs in Desktop play.

	 * In order for the portal to look correct in VR, the player's avatar's
	 * stereo separation (aka IPD, aka distance between eyes) is needed. Note
	 * it's NOT the headset's IPD! The value changes with avatar height.
	 *
	 * The stereo separation value is not provided natively to Udon, but there
	 * are some ways of getting it indirectly. Notably, by finding "tracking
	 * scale", which is the proportion of how much the avatar's head moves in
	 * game compared to how much the user's head moves in their real playspace.
	 * Multiplying the tracking scale by the default stereo separation, which
	 * can be read from the dummy VR cameras, gives us the avatar's IPD.
	 *
	 * There are two ways (that I'm aware of as of this writing) to accurately
	 * get the tracking scale:
	 *
	 *  A. Active GameObjects that have an Audio Listener component have their
	 *     scale set to 1/trackingScale. Don't ask me why.
	 *
	 *  B. Using Merlin's PlayspaceTracking prefab:
	 *     https://github.com/MerlinVR/PlayspaceTracking
	 *     The scale of the HeadRoot object is set to the tracking scale using
	 *     some clever Camera tricks. However this method suffers from floating
	 *     point precision error in large worlds, and also jitters a bit when
	 *     switching avatars.
	 *
	 * Both of these methods are a hack and could easily break at any time with
	 * a VRChat update, but method A is the fastest and most accurate way right
	 * now. Also the Audio Listener is easy to instantiate from a prefab at
	 * runtime. Therefore, that is the default method for UdonPortals.
	 *
	 * But to account for the fact that the Audio Listener mode may break
	 * eventually, this property lets you select a different way to determine
	 * stero separation. The possible values are:
	 *
	 *  0: Default; uses Method A. Stereo separation is computed as:
	 *        (1.0/trackingScale.localScale.x) * default_stereo_separation
	 *     Also, if the 'trackingScale' property is set to null, the TrackingScale
	 *     prefab is automatically instantiated at /PortalTrackingScale if it
	 *     doesn't already exist. 'trackingScale' is then set to that object.
	 *
	 *  1: Stereo separation is computed as:
	 *        trackingScale.localScale.x * default_stereo_separation
	 *     If the default method breaks, use this mode along with Method B,
	 *     Merlin's PlayspaceTracking. Set the 'trackingScale' object to the
	 *     HeadRoot object in Merlin's prefab.
	 *
	 *  2: Stereo separation is taken directly from the 'manualStereoSeparation'
